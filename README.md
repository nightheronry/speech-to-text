## Overview

This humix modules is essentially a wrapper to a few STT engines. The goal is to simplify the effort required to use STT technologies so that the higher level component (e.g. Humix-Think) can easily receive the recognized text and issue text to be sythesized. As an analogy, this module gives the ear and mouth to a robot, or cognitive device in general.

For tts engine, currently supported engines are `ITRI` (en/cht) . for more inforamtion about ITRI, please check [here](http://tts.itri.org.tw/)
